# STM32F103C8 I2C EEPROM Interface

This repository contains firmware code for interfacing an STM32F103C8 microcontroller with an I2C-compatible EEPROM. The firmware enables communication between the STM32F103C8 and the I2C EEPROM, allowing for reading from and writing to the EEPROM memory.

## Features

- Read and write operations between STM32F103C8 and I2C EEPROM.
- Implementation of basic functionalities such as reading from and writing to specific memory addresses.
- Error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable communication.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32F103C8 Microcontroller (Blue Pill).
- I2C-Compatible EEPROM.

## Software Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or any other compatible IDE for STM32 development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred STM32 development IDE.
3. Configure the project settings according to your hardware setup.
4. Build and flash the firmware to your STM32F103C8 microcontroller.
5. Connect the STM32F103C8 to the I2C-compatible EEPROM.
6. Power up the setup and verify communication between the microcontroller and the EEPROM.
